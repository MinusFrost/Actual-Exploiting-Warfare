# Actual-Exploiting-Warfare
I don't know how to actually update the script, so i created this repository just for me to actually update it.

While this sounds ridiculous (to the era warfare devs and mods), I'm actually retaliating.
"Why i am retaliating?" you may ask.. well that's a good question with a long answer, but all of this has a story behind it, so i will tell mine.

When i started playing Roblox typical colors 2 after i quitted on October 2021, I just encountered flanker mains ruining the fun for everyone, including me.
I ended up rejoining server after server, over and over again, with no hope.

Well, what i did next was to literally send death threats (go jump off a building, d1e in a fire, etc.), being extremely toxic and accusing them of using cheats to every flanker main i encountered on the servers i was in. I really didn't care anymore.

One day, I just thought to myself: "Why do that? my mental health is being destroyed because of those pieces of shit named scout mains, i'm just being a bad person in general, so i'll just quit the game for good." And i managed to do that in probably under a month.

Then, probably after 2 months i quit TC2, I found a game named "Era Warfare", in which it was a merged class TF2-Based game and had 10x less players than TC2. So i moved on to that game, and i actually got good at the game without those scout mains dominating me everytime (the only thing that is a piece of shit is the chat filter). Until i found a SCOUT MAIN on the server i was playing at (probably when the halloween event took place). I. Had. Enough.

I remembered the times i did in the past, when i was playing TC2, sending unnecesary shit to flanker mains, everything. And then proceeded to do the exact same thing, sent death threats to it, being extremely toxic to it, you get the point. 

Then, i remembered that cheating scripts exist, and thought to myself: "Maybe i can retaliate, just to get that sweet, sweet revenge on those pieces of shit that destroyed my mental health."

I then proceeded to work on it, using an UI Library i could use for my script, and put my time to work on it.
Getting some ideas inspired from other cheating scripts with some exceptions, just for me to retaliate would be worth it, so i kept working on it more and more, until i was finished.

To kindly summarize everything, I quitted TC2 on October 2021 and rejoined it almost a year later but I kept getting dominated by flanker mains, and then sent death threats, being extremely toxic to them, and accused them of using aimbot, and then quitted the game for good. Then, i moved on to a game named "Era Warfare", in which didn't have actual good graphics but it was fun, got good at the game, encountered ANOTHER scout main played the game during halloween, then did the exact same thing, and started working on a cheating script to retaliate.

And this is where we are now. I really hope the devs are ready to pach every exploit they possibly can.

Also, to the flanker mains whose destroyed my mental health, FUCK YOU ALL.
